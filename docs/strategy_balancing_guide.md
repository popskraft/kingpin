# Strategy Balancing Guide - Complete System Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the four-strategy balancing system for the Kingpin card game. The system ensures balanced gameplay by giving each strategy unique advantages and disadvantages while maintaining counter-play opportunities.

## Data Files

1. **[`../config/strategy_mechanics.csv`](../config/strategy_mechanics.csv)** - Main table with card parameters for each strategy
2. **[`../config/event_strategy_mechanics.csv`](../config/event_strategy_mechanics.csv)** - Event card effectiveness table
3. **[`../config/cards.csv`](../config/cards.csv)** - Original card database
4. **[`../config/default.yaml`](../config/default.yaml)** - Game configuration settings

## Core Balancing Principles

Each strategy has distinct strengths and weaknesses that create diverse gameplay experiences and prevent any single strategy from dominating the meta.

## Strategy Analysis

### 1. Attack Strategy

**Core Principle**: Maximum damage output at the cost of defense and economy

**Parameter Modifiers**:
- **HP**: -1 to -2 (sacrifice survivability for attack power)
- **ATK**: +2 to +3 (significant damage increase)
- **Price**: -1 (reduce cost for faster deployment)
- **Corruption**: -1 to -2 (less corruption = more attack power)
- **Defend**: 0 or -1 (minimal defense)
- **Rage**: +1 to +2 (additional damage output)

**Strengths**:
- Rapid elimination of enemy cards
- Effective against economy and flexible strategies
- High damage potential

**Weaknesses**:
- Low survivability
- Vulnerable to defensive strategies
- Limited economic base

**Best Cards for the Strategy**:
- `solo_killer` (Assassin) - ATK 7, Rage 3
- `loner_sniper` (Sniper) - ATK 6, Rage 2
- `authority_swat` (SWAT Operative) - ATK 5, Rage 2
- `unique_authority` (General) - ATK 5, Rage 4

**Recommended Events**:
- `event_war` (Gang War) - effectiveness 0.9
- `event_raid` (Raid) - effectiveness 0.8

### 2. Defense Strategy

**Core Principle**: Maximum survivability and field control

**Parameter Modifiers**:
- **HP**: +2 to +3 (significant health increase)
- **ATK**: -1 to -2 (sacrifice damage for defense)
- **Price**: +1 (slight cost increase)
- **Corruption**: -1 (less corruption = more defense)
- **Defend**: +2 to +3 (maximum defense)
- **Rage**: 0 or -1 (minimal aggression)

**Strengths**:
- High survivability
- Effective against attack strategies
- Stable economic base

**Weaknesses**:
- Slow game pace
- Vulnerable to economy strategies
- Limited damage output

**Best Cards for the Strategy**:
- `authority_shieldbearer` (Bodyguards) - HP 7, Defend 5
- `unique_authority` (General) - HP 9, Defend 5
- `unique_gangster` (Godfather) - HP 9, Defend 5
- `solo_watchman` (Sentry) - HP 5, Defend 5

**Recommended Events**:
- `event_crash` (Market Crash) - effectiveness 0.8
- `event_safe` (Safe Cracked) - effectiveness 0.7
- `event_roundup` (Roundup) - effectiveness 0.7

### 3. Economy Strategy

**Core Principle**: Resource control and economic manipulation

**Parameter Modifiers**:
- **HP**: -1 (sacrifice health for economy)
- **ATK**: -1 to -2 (minimal damage)
- **Price**: -1 to -2 (reduce cost for rapid deployment)
- **Corruption**: +2 to +3 (high corruption for economic manipulation)
- **Defend**: 0 or -1 (minimal defense)
- **Rage**: 0 (neutral aggression)

**Strengths**:
- Rapid resource accumulation
- Effective against defensive strategies
- Flexibility in card purchasing

**Weaknesses**:
- Vulnerable to attack strategies
- Low survivability
- Dependency on economic cards

**Best Cards for the Strategy**:
- `solo_broker` (Broker) - Price 0, Corruption 5
- `loner_trader` (Trader) - Price 0, Corruption 4
- `gangster_thief` (Thief) - Price 0, Corruption 5
- `solo_informant` (Informant) - Price 0, Corruption 5

**Recommended Events**:
- `event_bonus` (Bonus) - effectiveness 0.9
- `event_safe` (Safe Cracked) - effectiveness 0.9
- `event_roundup` (Roundup) - effectiveness 0.8

### 4. Flexible Strategy

**Core Principle**: Balanced parameters for situational adaptation

**Parameter Modifiers**:
- **HP**: 0 (base health)
- **ATK**: 0 (base attack)
- **Price**: 0 (base cost)
- **Corruption**: 0 (base corruption)
- **Defend**: 0 (base defense)
- **Rage**: 0 (base aggression)

**Strengths**:
- Adaptability to any situation
- Stable parameters
- Ability to switch between strategies

**Weaknesses**:
- No clear advantages
- May lose to specialized strategies
- Requires high skill level

**Best Cards for the Strategy**:
- `unique_loner` (Legend) - balanced parameters
- `authority_swat` (SWAT Operative) - versatility
- `solo_killer` (Assassin) - flexible use
- `authority_financier` (Financier) - economic stability

**Recommended Events**:
- `event_recruit` (Recruitment) - effectiveness 0.8
- `event_bonus` (Bonus) - effectiveness 0.7

## Special Cases

### Unique Cards (Boss/Unique)
- Receive additional bonuses in all strategies
- Maintain their uniqueness and power
- Have more pronounced differences between strategies

### Clan Cards
- **Gangsters**: Better in attack and economy strategies
- **Authorities**: Better in defense and flexible strategies
- **Loners**: Better in flexible and economy strategies
- **Solo**: Better in attack and flexible strategies

### Faction Cards
- **Stormers**: Enhanced in attack strategy
- **Specialists**: Enhanced in defense strategy
- **Slippery**: Enhanced in economy strategy
- **Heads**: Enhanced in flexible strategy

## Balancing Formulas

### Total Card Power
```
Total Power = (HP * 0.3) + (ATK * 0.4) + (Defend * 0.2) + (Rage * 0.1)
```

### Economic Efficiency
```
Economic Efficiency = (Total Power / Price) * (1 - Corruption * 0.1)
```

### Strategy Specialization
```
Attack Specialization = ATK * 2 + Rage - HP * 0.5
Defense Specialization = HP * 2 + Defend - ATK * 0.5
Economy Specialization = (1/Price) * 2 + Corruption - ATK * 0.3
Flexible Specialization = (HP + ATK + Defend + Rage) / 4
```

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Attack Strategy**: Use cards with high ATK and Rage, ignore defense
2. **Defense Strategy**: Focus on cards with high HP and Defend
3. **Economy Strategy**: Choose cards with low cost and high corruption
4. **Flexible Strategy**: Select cards with balanced parameters

## System Strengths

1. **Variety of strategies**: Each strategy has unique advantages
2. **Counter-strategies**: Each strategy has effective counters
3. **Faction traits**: Different factions fit different strategies better
4. **Scalability**: The system easily expands with new cards

## Potential Issues

1. **Dominance of the attack strategy**: May be too effective against economy strategies
2. **Slow pace of the defense strategy**: May be boring for players
3. **Complexity of the economy strategy**: Requires high skill
4. **Uncertainty of the flexible strategy**: May be less appealing

## Improvement Recommendations

### 1. Nerf the Attack Strategy
- Reduce ATK bonus from +2–3 to +1–2
- Increase HP penalty from -1–2 to -2–3

### 2. Buff the Defense Strategy
- Add passive recovery abilities
- Increase effectiveness of defense events

### 3. Simplify the Economy Strategy
- Add more cards with economic abilities
- Improve synergy between economic cards

### 4. Improve the Flexible Strategy
- Add unique adaptation abilities
- Increase late-game effectiveness

## Automatic Calculation Formulas

### Overall Card Power in Strategy
```python
def calculate_card_power(card, strategy):
    if strategy == "attack":
        return (card.hp - 1) * 0.3 + (card.atk + 2) * 0.4 + (card.defend - 0.5) * 0.2 + (card.rage + 1) * 0.1
    elif strategy == "defense":
        return (card.hp + 2) * 0.3 + (card.atk - 1) * 0.4 + (card.defend + 2) * 0.2 + card.rage * 0.1
    elif strategy == "economy":
        return (card.hp - 1) * 0.3 + (card.atk - 1) * 0.4 + card.defend * 0.2 + card.rage * 0.1
    else:  # flexible
        return card.hp * 0.3 + card.atk * 0.4 + card.defend * 0.2 + card.rage * 0.1
```

### Deck Efficiency
```python
def calculate_deck_efficiency(deck, strategy):
    total_power = sum(calculate_card_power(card, strategy) for card in deck)
    total_cost = sum(card.price for card in deck)
    return total_power / total_cost if total_cost > 0 else 0
```

## Balance Monitoring

Regularly check:
- Win rates for each strategy
- Game duration for each strategy
- Strategy popularity among players
- Balance complaints

Adjust parameter modifiers as needed to achieve optimal balance.

## Conclusion

The designed system provides a balanced game experience with four distinct strategies. Each strategy has strengths and weaknesses, creating an engaging meta and preventing a single strategy from dominating.

It is recommended to regularly playtest balance and adjust parameters based on game statistics and player feedback.
