## Detailed Analysis of Changes

### Removing Factions

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simplifies synergy system — only one type (clan)
- ✅ Reduces cognitive load
- ✅ Clearer and more predictable synergies
- ✅ Aligns with “simplify abilities” recommendation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Loss of strategic depth — fewer combinations
- ❌ Reduced replayability due to less variety
- ❌ Potential loss of uniqueness for some cards

**Conflicts:**
- ⚠️ Conflicts with the goal of high strategic depth
- ⚠️ May reduce ability combinatorics

**Impact on Metrics:**
- Ease of Learning: +2.0
- Fun/Engagement: -1.0
- Strategic Depth: -1.5
- Replayability: -1.0
- Balance: +1.0

### New Combat System

**Pros:**
- ✅ Significant simplification of combat
- ✅ Shift from complex calculations to fixed values
- ✅ Shield cap at 4 — predictability
- ✅ Clear clan synergies (2+ cards)
- ✅ Aligns with “simplify abilities” recommendation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Loss of tactical depth
- ❌ Fewer tuning options for cards
- ❌ Risk of repetitive interactions
- ❌ Requires full card rework

**Conflicts:**
- ⚠️ May reduce strategic depth
- ⚠️ Conflicts with high current fun/engagement rating

**Impact on Metrics:**
- Ease of Learning: +3.0
- Fun/Engagement: -2.0
- Strategic Depth: -2.0
- Replayability: -0.5
- Balance: +2.0

### Purchasing System With Privacy

**Pros:**
- ✅ Interesting card privacy mechanic
- ✅ Increased starting money (18 instead of 3) — more choices
- ✅ All cards must be purchased — clear economy
- ✅ Strategic choice: secrecy vs saving
- ✅ Reserve adds interaction

**Cons:**
- ❌ Harder for new players — extra rules
- ❌ May slow the game due to economic decisions
- ❌ Risk of imbalance between rich and poor players

**Conflicts:**
- ⚠️ Increases complexity; conflicts with simplification
- ⚠️ May increase game length

**Impact on Metrics:**
- Ease of Learning: -1.5
- Fun/Engagement: +2.0
- Strategic Depth: +2.5
- Replayability: +1.5
- Balance: -0.5

### Attack Limitation (3 Cards)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Prevents overwhelming attacks
- ✅ Tactical choice of which cards to use
- ✅ Allows mixing clans in an attack

**Cons:**
- ❌ Limitation may frustrate players
- ❌ Fewer epic mass-attack moments

**Impact on Metrics:**
- Ease of Learning: +0.5
- Fun/Engagement: -0.5
- Strategic Depth: +1.0
- Balance: +1.0

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Alignment With Initial Recommendations

**Original analyzer recommendations:**
- Simplify or merge similar abilities
- Make pricing more logical
- Add more cards per clan
- Add more simple cards for balance

**How proposals align:**
- ✅ Ability simplification: remove factions and new combat system
- ✅ Logical pricing: new purchasing system
- ❌ More cards per clan: not solved by proposals
- ✅ Simple cards: new combat system simplifies cards

### Key Risks

1. **Loss of strategic depth** (-3.5 trend)
2. **Reduced fun/engagement** (-1.5 trend)
3. **Need for full card rework**
4. **Risk of over-simplification**

### Recommendations to Improve Proposals

**Critical:**
- Preserve strategic depth elements during simplification
- Add compensating mechanics for fun/engagement
- Test changes incrementally, not all at once

**Additional:**
- Increase cards per clan (initial recommendation)
- Add new synergy types instead of removed factions
- Consider a hybrid combat system (simpler but not trivial)
- Add a tutorial mode for the purchasing system
