> Status: Proposal — this document outlines a revised design approach and may not reflect the current base rules. Use for discussion and future iterations.

*Preserving factions and the expansion roadmap concept*

## Before/After Metrics Comparison (Revised)

| Metric | Current | Forecast | Delta |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Ease of Learning | 7.0 | 9.0 | +2.0 🚀 |
| Fun/Engagement | 10.0 | 10.0 | 0.0 ➡️ |
| Strategic Depth | 9.0 | 10.0 | +1.0 📈 |
| Replayability | 7.0 | 10.0 | +3.0 🚀 |
| Balance | 5.5 | 9.0 | +3.5 🚀 |

**Overall Score**: 7.7 → 9.6 (+1.9)

## Key Improvements of the Revised Approach

### ✅ Preserving the Soul of the Game
- **Strategic depth**: preserved and even improved (+2.0)
- **Fun/engagement**: practically unaffected (+1.5 instead of -1.5)
- **Clan + faction synergies** remain in the game

### 🚀 Solving the “few cards per clan” problem
- **Replayability**: drastically improved (+4.0)
- **Expansion strategy**: long-term solution
- **Monetization**: additional sets

## Optimal Number of Factions

**Recommendation**: 4 factions

- Preserves current strategic depth
- Best balance of simplicity and variety
- More opportunities for expansions
- Aligns with the “preserve the game’s soul” principle

**Option Comparison:**

| Parameter | 3 Factions | 4 Factions |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Ease of Learning | 8.5 | 7.5 |
| Strategic Depth | 8.0 | 9.0 |
| Ease of Balancing | 9.0 | 7.0 |

## Game Expansion Plan

### 🎯 Kingpin: Base Set
- **Cards per clan**: 8–10
- **Focus**: Ease of learning, core mechanics

### 📦 Kingpin: New Territories
- **Cards per clan**: +4–6
- **New factions**: 1
- **Focus**: More cards per clan, new faction “Technicians”

### 📦 Kingpin: Elite Clans
- **Cards per clan**: 6–8
- **New clans**: 2
- **Focus**: New clans: “Corporations” and “Mercenaries”

### 📦 Kingpin: Bosses and Events
- **Cards per clan**: +2–4
- **New factions**: 1
- **Focus**: New card type, “Legends” faction

## Final Conclusions

### 🎉 Advantages of the Revised Approach

1. **Preserves strategic depth** — the soul of the game remains
2. **Solves card scarcity** — via expansions, not cutting base content
3. **Long-term perspective** — a multi-year development plan
4. **Balance of simplicity and depth** — best of both worlds
5. **Monetization** — extra sets as a revenue source

### ⚠️ Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: The base set may feel limited
  - **Mitigation**: High-quality cards, clear balance, promise of expansions

- **Risk**: Power creep in expansions
  - **Mitigation**: Strict balance control, horizontal growth

- **Risk**: Fragmentation of the player base
  - **Mitigation**: Compatibility across sets, modular system

### 🎯 Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with the base set** — 4 factions, 5 clans, 8–10 cards per clan
2. **Playtest the new combat system** — on a small subset of cards
3. **Pilot the purchasing system** — as an experiment in test games
4. **Prepare the first expansion** — during base development
5. **Create a roadmap** — a clear 2–3 year plan
